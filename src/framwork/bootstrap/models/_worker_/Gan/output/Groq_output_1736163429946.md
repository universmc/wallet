Let's break down this context and figure out what it's asking for. 

**Understanding the Context:**

* **Développement du modèle _GAM_:** This likely refers to the development of a new text generation model called "GAM." 
* **Entraînement par pair de l'abritre du Match entre 'groq' et 'Gemini':** This suggests a training process involving two models, "groq" and "Gemini," possibly in a competitive or comparative setting. "Abritre du Match" translates to "match referee" hinting at a structured evaluation. 
* **Les fonctionnalités initiales de > prompt --engine --help:** This part seems to be related to the command line interface or configuration for using the GAM model.  The `--help` flag indicates a request for information about available commands and options.

**Putting it Together**

The context describes a scenario where a new text generation model (GAM) is being developed and evaluated.  The evaluation process involves comparing GAM to two other models ("groq" and "Gemini") in a competitive setting.  

**Possible Tasks:**

Based on this context, here are some tasks that might be involved:

1. **Develop the GAM model:** This would involve designing the model architecture, training it on a suitable dataset, and optimizing its performance.
2. **Implement the "match" environment:** This would require setting up a framework to compare the performance of "groq," "Gemini," and GAM on various text generation tasks.
3. **Define evaluation metrics:**  Metrics like perplexity, BLEU score, or human evaluation would be needed to measure the quality of the generated text.
4. **Document the command line interface:** The `--help` flag suggests a need for clear documentation on how to use the GAM model, including available commands and parameters.
