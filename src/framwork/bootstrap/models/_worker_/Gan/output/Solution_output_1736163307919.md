It seems like you're aiming to develop a new text generation model called "_GAM_" and train it using a peer-to-peer learning approach with a focus on improving the "abritre du Match" (match referee) functionality for text comparing tasks.  

Let's break down your request and explore how we can achieve this:

**Understanding Your Goals:**

* **_GAM_ Model:** You want to create a novel text generation model named "_GAM_".  This model will likely be based on transformer architectures like GPT, but with potential modifications tailored for your specific needs.

* **Peer-to-Peer Training:** You're interested in using a peer-to-peer learning approach for training "_GAM_". This means having multiple instances of the model learn from each other's outputs, potentially leading to faster convergence and better generalization.

* **"Abritre du Match" Functionality:**  The core purpose of "_GAM_" is to act as a "match referee" for comparing texts. This suggests tasks like:
    * **Plagiarism Detection:** Identifying if two texts are substantially similar.
    * **Text Summarization:** Comparing summaries generated by different models and selecting the best one.
    * **Paraphrase Detection:** Determining if two texts convey the same meaning but in different words.
    * **Quality Assessment:**  Evaluating the overall quality of a text based on factors like coherence, grammar, and style.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Dataset:**  You'll need a large and diverse dataset of text pairs for training "_GAM_". The nature of the dataset will depend on the specific "abritre du Match" tasks you want to focus on.

* **Model Architecture:** While GPT-based architectures are a strong starting point, you may need to explore modifications to better suit the comparative nature of your tasks.

* **Evaluation Metrics:**  Choose appropriate metrics to evaluate the performance of "_GAM_".  For plagiarism detection, BLEU, ROUGE, or other similarity metrics might be useful. For summarization or paraphrasing, metrics like ROUGE-L or METEOR could be more relevant.

* **Ethical Implications:**  Text comparison models can have ethical implications, especially in plagiarism detection.  Ensure your model is used responsibly and fairly.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Define Your Tasks:** Clearly articulate the specific "abritre du Match" tasks you want "_GAM_" to excel at.

2. **Gather Data:** Collect a relevant and representative dataset for training.

3. **Choose a Model:** Select a suitable GPT-based architecture or explore modifications for your specific needs.

4. **Implement Peer-to-Peer Training:**  Research and implement an effective peer-to-peer training strategy.

5. **Evaluate and Refine:**  Continuously evaluate "_GAM_" using appropriate metrics and refine its architecture, training process, and dataset as needed.
